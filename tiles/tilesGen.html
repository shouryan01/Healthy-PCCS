                      <h6 class="stclr">(Try to read one everyday!)</h6>
                      <br><br>
                      <div align="left">
                          <ol>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Embrace nutrition basics. Eating right doesn’t have to be complicated. Forget the fad diets and adopt a healthy eating plan including a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Move more. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity, such as walking, each week to assist in weight maintenance and overall health.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Be smoke-free. Make a plan for the challenges you will face and keep trying your best. Seek support and talk to your doctor about medications that can double your chances of quitting for good.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Schedule sleep. Make sleep a priority to enjoy a more focused, energy-filled lifestyle. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine and change your electronic device settings to the “night-shift” mode.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Prioritize preventive screenings. Many medical conditions can be recognized in the early stages by getting preventive screenings and immunizations. Ask your doctor about what screenings are recommended for you.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Connect with others. Building a community of people who can help you through life’s ups and downs is a vital step towards happiness and good health. Invest in relationships that provide encouragement and accountability to both parties.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Stress Less. Gratitude has been shown to lower stress, which prevents many other physical and mental consequences. Instead of focusing on what your body can’t do or how you wish your body looked, try expressing gratitude for where you are now and the opportunity to make improvements.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Work toward or maintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight, work toward losing 5-7% of your weight to significantly reduce your health risks. Studies show that individuals who track their intake using an app, such as myfitnesspal, lose more weight and keep it off compared to those who don’t track.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Set SMART goals. General goals such as “exercise more” are not effective. A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, and Timely. “I will walk 20 minutes over my lunch break on Tuesdays and Thursdays” is a SMART goal.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="selector stclr2">Stay positive. Health goals don’t always go as planned. When you face challenges, focus on all of the positive changes you have made, no matter how small they seem. Treat yourself with kindness, like you would a good friend.</li>
