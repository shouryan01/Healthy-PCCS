	<div class="card text-center">
			<div class="card-body">
				

				<h4 class="selector stclr" align="left">When you sleep, your brain restores. Good sleep habits can result in:</h4>
				<div align="left">
				<ol>
				<li class="selector stclr2">Have A Routine. By establishing a set bedtime and waking time, you help to regulate your body's "circadian clock," the internal mechanism which balances sleep and waking. Also, by creating a routine around bedtime you can help yourself get into a “sleepy” frame of mind. This means coming up with something to do every night before bed, whether it's a hot bath, reading a book or listening to music. This routine then becomes a cue for your body that it's time for sleep.</li>
				<br>
				<li class="selector stclr2">Exercise. Getting exercise during the day will make falling asleep at night easier, although exercising within 2-3 hours of going to sleep will actually make it harder for you to sleep.</li>
				<br>
				<li class="selector stclr2">What you use your bed for. Everything has its place, only use your bed for sleep and sex. This helps to strengthen the association between sleep and your bed. Doing homework and other activities in bed weaken this association and may minimize your ability to sleep.</li>
				<br>
				<li class="selector stclr2">Timing is everything. Plan ahead so you won’t have to pull all-nighters. Time management and sleep are related, particularly since sleep may be one of the first things to suffer when time is crunched. In the long run, losing sleep only hurts performance. All-nighters are bad for your body and you retain much less information than you would with even 90 minutes of sleep.</li>
