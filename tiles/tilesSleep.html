	<p class="selector stclr">At the end of the day when we need to calm down and relieve stress or get a good sleep:</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">1. Sit in a position that is comfortable with your hands resting on your knees and your eyes gently closed.</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">2. Think about relaxing each part of your body, including your forehead, eyes, jaw, neck, shoulders, hips, and legs.</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">3. Breathe in and on the exhale tilt your head towards your chin. On the next exhale, lift your head towards the ceiling. On the next, tilt to the right. Finally, tilt to the left on the next exhale. Rotate your head in slow circles, twice in one direction and twice in the other. Make sure you keep breathing!</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">4. Place your hands on your shoulders and rotate them in three forward circles and three reverse circles. Think about sitting tall as you do this and breathe slowly with each rotation. Focus on the Breath</p>
	
	<h2 align="center" class="stclr2">Why is sleep important?</h2>
	<p class="selector stclr">When you sleep, your brain restores. Good sleep habits can result in:</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Improved mood</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Increased ability to concentrate</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Better retention of new information</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Quicker thinking</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Improved immune system response</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">->Enhanced motor skills</p>
	
	<h2 align="center" class="stclr2">QUICK TIPS TO HELP WITH SLEEP:</h2>
	<p class="selector stclr">Have A Routine. By establishing a set bedtime and waking time, you help to regulate your body's "circadian clock," the internal mechanism which balances sleep and waking. Also, by creating a routine around bedtime you can help yourself get into a “sleepy” frame of mind. This means coming up with something to do every night before bed, whether it's a hot bath, reading a book or listening to music. This routine then becomes a cue for your body that it's time for sleep.</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">Exercise. Getting exercise during the day will make falling asleep at night easier, although exercising within 2-3 hours of going to sleep will actually make it harder for you to sleep.</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">What you use your bed for. Everything has its place, only use your bed for sleep and sex. This helps to strengthen the association between sleep and your bed. Doing homework and other activities in bed weaken this association and may minimize your ability to sleep.</p>
	<p class="selector stclr">Timing is everything. Plan ahead so you won’t have to pull all-nighters. Time management and sleep are related, particularly since sleep may be one of the first things to suffer when time is crunched. In the long run, losing sleep only hurts performance. All-nighters are bad for your body and you retain much less information than you would with even 90 minutes of sleep.</p>
